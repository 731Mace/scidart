# Scidart
Scidart is a experimental cross-platform scientific library for dart.

## Goals
Your main goal is run where Dart can run, in other words, run on Flutter, Dart CLI, Dart web, etc.

## Motivation
Some time ago I tried make a guitar tuner with Flutter and I faced with the problem: Dart dind't have scientific library with main scientific algorithms. 
So, I tried implement something to help me with that problem.

## Instalation

## Examples

## Documentation

## How to contribute
I recommend see the Todo List and choose a function to implement or choose a problem and implement the parts that are missing in Scidart.

All the contribution need have tests, documentation and examples, otherwise, the pull request will be rejected.

## Todo list
* complex numbers algebra (ok)
* polyfit (ok)
* documentation with examples(ok)
* function to time the execution of a process (ok)
* circular convolution (ok)
* convolution (ok)
* random (ok)
* read txt (ok)
* read csv (ok)
* separate fast math (ok)
* test fast math (ok)
* refactor array(ok), array2d(ok), arrayComplex(ok), Complex(ok) class to be more functional
* write matrix operations tests (ok)
* implement determinant calculation (ok)
* integration and derivation (ok)
* filter FIR (ok)
* dbConverters (ok)
* filter IIR
* generate a plot in memory (delegated to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43703802/flutter-draw-graphs-on-the-screen)
* logSpace (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/generated/numpy.logspace.html)
* write some examples: frequency stimator, step counter, FM modulation, AM modulation
* write a CLI to interact with the lib
* publish package
* show to the comunity
* write readme
